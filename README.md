This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


Sure! Here's a README.md file that explains how to use your GitHub repository:

```markdown
# Weather App

This repository contains a Next.js application that displays weather details for a chosen city using the ChatGPT API. It utilizes weather data from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/). To enhance the integration of the weather data, we utilize StepZen to generate weather types and integrate them into the Next.js app.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (version X.X.X or higher)
- Git

## Getting Started

To use this repository and run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create an account on [StepZen](https://stepzen.com/) if you don't already have one. StepZen is used to generate weather types and integrate them into the Next.js app.

5. Once you have created an account on StepZen, initialize StepZen into your Next.js app by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npx stepzen init
   ```

   This command will guide you through the initialization process and create the necessary configuration files.

6. After initializing StepZen, open the `.env.local` file in the project root and add your StepZen API key. It should look like this:

   ```dotenv
   STEPZEN_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

7. Now, go to [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) and navigate to the desired weather properties. Copy the link for the specified weather properties that you want to use in your app.

8. Open the `pages/api/weather.ts` file in your code editor. Replace the `WEATHER_API_URL` constant with the copied link:

   ```typescript
   const WEATHER_API_URL = 'PASTE_COPIED_LINK_HERE';
   ```

9. Save the file.

10. Finally, start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The Weather App should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can choose a city on the home page and view the weather details on the subsequent page.
